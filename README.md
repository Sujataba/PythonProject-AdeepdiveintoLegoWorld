# Project Overview
In this project, I've analyzed a fascinating dataset on every single Lego block that has ever been built!
I've started with analyzing the popularity of various Lego sets and themes using the dataset provided for an example company which is Denmark's well-known Lego Group. 
# Objective
The goal is to understand the history of Lego blocks.
